# ImageManagementTool
We are a team of two. We made an image management tool. You can upload your images and start playing with it! 

Function:
1). Allow user to upload images from desktop. 
2). Show images to users.  
3). Show image properties (height, width, format and file location). 
4). Allow users to convert to different images formats. 
5). Allow users to download converted images. 
6). Some image basic effects (black and white, add color)
7). Some image basic editing (rotate, resize, add watermark)

Tools:
We used JavaFX, Scene builder and ImageMagick. Please make sure you have Image Magick Jar file and software, and then you are good to go!
